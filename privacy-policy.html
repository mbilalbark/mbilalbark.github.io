            <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the data handling practices for our apps and their future versions (referred to as “us,” “we,” or “our”) 
                and is subject to our Terms of Use. In this Privacy Policy, “Service” refers to our products and services. 
                Your use of the Service signifies agreement with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Service.
            </p>
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                When you install and register for the Service, we may collect personal information, such as your email address, location, name, and optional details. If you log in via social accounts, such as Facebook, additional information may be gathered according to your account settings.
                Upon granting access, we may also collect contact information from your device’s address book to synchronize across devices and provide an enhanced user experience. Non-personally identifiable information, such as country of residence, device details, IP address, and app usage data, may also be collected to optimize Service performance.
                Our apps may allow sharing of messages, photos, and videos with other users. Such content will be stored on our servers and may not be removable once shared. If any shared content is reported due to abusive behavior, this content may be transferred to our servers and reviewed as needed.
                If you complete a transaction, you’ll be asked to provide payment information, such as credit card details. This information is processed securely by third-party vendors, and we do not store payment data on our servers.
                To improve app stability, we may collect error-reporting information if the Service crashes, including device details and app state at the error time. This information is used solely for diagnostic purposes.
            </p>
            <h2>Sharing of Your Information</h2>
            <p style="padding: 100;">We do not rent or sell your information to third parties without your consent, except as outlined below:</p>
