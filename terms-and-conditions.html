            <p>
                By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – please read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re also not permitted to attempt to extract the source code, translate the app into other languages, or create derivative versions. The app, along with all trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights, belong to us.
                We are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. Therefore, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it clear to you what you’re paying for.
                The app stores and processes personal data provided to us to offer our services. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We recommend you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which could make your device vulnerable to malware, compromise its security features, and potentially prevent the app from functioning correctly.
                The app uses third-party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.
                
            </p>
            <h2>Limitations of Responsibility</h2>
            <p>
                Certain functions of the app require an active internet connection. While we strive to provide reliable services, we cannot guarantee full functionality if you lack an internet connection or have exhausted your data allowance.
                If you use the app outside of Wi-Fi coverage, note that your mobile network provider’s terms still apply. You may be responsible for data and roaming charges incurred by your mobile provider. Please ensure you have permission from the bill payer if applicable.
            </p>
            <h2>Updates and Availability</h2>
            <p>
                At times, updates to the app may be necessary. The app is currently available on iOS, and system requirements may change. You may need to download updates to continue using the app. We don’t guarantee ongoing compatibility with your device’s operating system, and you agree to accept updates when offered. We may terminate the app’s availability without notice, and upon termination, you must stop using and delete the app if necessary.
            </p>
            <h2>Abuse Prevention and Rate Limiting</h2>
            <p style="padding: 100;">We do not rent or sell your information to third parties without your consent, except as outlined below:</p>
            <div>

                    <li>Automatic Analysis and Interruption: Our systems actively monitor user activity to prevent misuse or abuse. If harmful usage patterns are detected, your access may be automatically restricted.</li>
                    <li>Purpose of Rate Limiting: Rate limiting ensures stability and reliability, providing a seamless experience for all users.</li>
                    <li>Behavior Detection and Blocking: Advanced algorithms identify suspicious or harmful behavior, potentially resulting in temporary blocks.</li>
                    <li>Temporary Blocks: Restrictions are temporary, ensuring genuine users can resume access once lifted.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>By using our services, you agree to comply with these terms and acknowledge the rate-limiting measures in place to protect our systems and user community.
